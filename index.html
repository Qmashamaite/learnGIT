	<h1>Learning git</h1>

	<p> i can use (git add) . to add file that i would like to put on the stage. that when i make changes to it git can tell me only if i do the (git add) and (git status). (git commit) make the changes work. to comment the commit i can use (git commit -m'balaksjs...')</p>

	<p> i used another branch to change this file using the command (git branch login). the 'login' is the name of the branch then to make changes that can't affect the master branch i switch to login branch by firstly saving it using (git add . & git commit) then i can use (git checkout login). once i have done that i can do whatever i want. but still have the original master, which i can go back to it by firstly saving it using (git add . & git commit) the i an use using (git checkout master). to merge the 2 i can say (git merge) </p>
